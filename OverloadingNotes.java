Multiple functions with the same name, but different signature.
known as polymorphism (multiple forms)
OOP principle
Two Types of Polymorphism -
Overloading, Overriding.
Overriding happens during inheritance, dynamic binding.

Principle is polymorphism

The methods exist in the same class,
static binding happens during overloading (matching of method
call with the appropriate method signature) on compilation.
