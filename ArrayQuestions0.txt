1) Write a program to accept a number, put it in an integer
array, and then print the highest and the lowest value of the
number.

2) WAP that prints the following series 1,3,7,15,31, 63,127 upto
n terms. Accept the value of n from the user.

3) Write a program to initialise an array of 5 names and initialize
another array with their respective telephone numbers.Search for a
name input by the user in the list. If found, display
"Search Successful" and print the name along with the telephone number
Otherwise display "Search unsuccessful, Name not enlisted".

4) Write a program to accept 10 names in an SDA, display only those
names which contain an even number of vowels.

5) Write a program to accept 10 integers in a SDA sort them in descending
irder using bubble sort technique.Display the original and sorted arrays.

6) What is the base type of an array?

7) Which element is arr[9] in an array?

9) Differentiate between bubble sort and selection sort techniques in java.

10)An SDA contains 'N' elements. What will be the position of the
last element of the array?

11) Differentiate between length() and length.

12) The array given below has to be sorted in the ascending order using
Bubble Sort Algorithm. In how many passes do you think will the
sorting be done? Show the appropriate passes.
    int n[]={9,100,89,27,3};

13) Write a program in Java to calculate and print the sum of all the
odd and sum of all even numbers of an int array m[10].
Accept the array from the user. Also ensure that the user does not
input 0. Zero should terminate the program.
